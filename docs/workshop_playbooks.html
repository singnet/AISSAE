    Chosen Palette: Calm Neutral
    Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a primary top navigation combined with a secondary sidebar navigation for nested topics (like Sense-Making variations). This creates a clear, hierarchical information architecture. Users select a high-level workshop, and the content dynamically updates in the main view. This prevents overwhelming the user with a long, single-document scroll and provides immediate access to the required playbook. The content itself is structured in a two-column layout—metadata on the left for a quick overview, and the detailed agenda on the right for in-depth guidance. This separation of "at-a-glance" info from "step-by-step" instructions is designed for optimal facilitator usability.
    Visualisation & Content Choices: The source report is procedural, not quantitative, so data charts are not used. Instead, the focus is on clarifying structure and process. Each "Playset" is presented as an interactive card. Key metadata points (like Time, Attendees) are paired with icons for quick recognition. The "Plays Used" are styled as distinct tags to highlight the building blocks of each workshop. The core of the application is the dynamic display of structured text, powered by JavaScript, to present the right guide at the right time. This approach turns a static document into a focused, interactive tool.
    CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used.
