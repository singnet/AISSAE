## What is the AISSE Framework?

* A template-driven framework for translating human values and preferences into AI development requirements at all levels
* A structured approach to considering risks and values across projects with increasing intelligence complexity
* A community-driven toolkit supporting developers to create AI that meets human expectations
* A mechanism for improving value alignment persistence as systems evolve beyond direct control
* A bridge connecting what we value to how we build AI systems

The framework is centered on giving developers access to information, assistance, tools, techniques and best-practice on AI Safety, Security and Ethics, relevant to *their project*

It consists of four major components

| <img src="media/AISSEDevComp.png" width="430" style="vertical-align: middle;">   | The AISSE Developer Companion is a grounded AI helper that can assist developers during the entire development effort. Key tasks it can help with:<br>- Identifying relevant values, principles and risks<br>- Running sessions on AISSE (e.g. Human-in-the-Loop checks, risk reviews)<br>- Translating areas where you want to focus on AISSE into user stories<br>- Scoring risks<br>- Creating evals and tests <br><br>                                                                                                                  |
| <img src="media/AISSEToolkit.png" width="130" style="vertical-align: middle;">   | The AISSE Toolkit is a set of tools, guides, community assistance, services and other information developers can use when they hit a roadblock in understanding of implementing AISSE for their projects. <br><br>It includes two libraries that give insight into what previous projects with similar profiles to the developers' did:<br>- risk, principles and values profiles: what did these projects focus on?<br>- mitigation and solution patterns: how did they address these?                                          |
| <img src="media/AISSECommunity.png" width="130" style="vertical-align: middle;"> | The Community of Practice plays a dual role. Firstly they provide their experience, skills, expertise and insights into the framework by curating information, offering services, tools and techniques.<br><br>They also govern the Framework, ensuring it meets the needs of developers and other community members as technological and social drivers shift. <br><br><br><br>                                                                                                                                                                        |
| <img src="media/AISSEPlatform.png" width="130" style="vertical-align: middle;">  | The AISSE platform enables the whole Framework. It is a GitHub hosted repository, enabling decentralised governance and contribution. From the GitHub backend, it can be<br><br>It also contains the logic and code to run the voluntary-membership AISSE Project Directory. By signing-up and using the markdown templates provided, developers can showcase their efforts and receive a badge representing their intent. The use of this decentralised approach allows other platforms and reputation systems to use the framework.<br><br>  |
