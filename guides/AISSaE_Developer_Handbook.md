## Introduction to the Framework

### Too long; didn’t read?

Understanding the framework is the best way to leverage it for value,
but if you’re time poor and looking for help the AISSE Developer
Companion AI can answer questions based on your project, and your
current activities. Ask it for help.

### What This Is

The AISSE Framework helps you, the developer, build AI systems that
benefit people by providing you with the tools and information you need
to make sound design decisions. It's not about perfect ethics or endless
processes, it's about being intentional and managing the things that
matter. At its heart the framework is about providing you with clearer,
less ambiguous information on the values and concerns that matter to
users. It is:

- A template-driven framework for translating human values and
  preferences into AI development requirements at all levels

- A structured approach to considering risks and values across projects
  with increasing intelligence complexity

- A community-driven toolkit supporting developers to create AI that
  meets human expectations

- A mechanism for improving value alignment persistence as systems
  evolve beyond direct control

- A bridge connecting what we value to how we build AI systems

### Why Use This

**As a developer you get:**

- Clearer understanding of what your users and society actually care
  about

- Practical risk management that fits your project

- Optimised features that align to values, not just functionality

- Documentation that demonstrates that you've thought things through

- A process that scales with your project size and where you choose the
  level of involvement

**Badging of your commitment**:

You will receive a badge that reflects your stated commitment

|----|----|----|----|

<sup>\#</sup> Requires registration on the framework and fill-out of
templates to provide information on your project. See Appendix A

**You reduce:**

- Building something people don't trust or want

- Nasty surprises after launch

- Reputation damage from preventable issues

- Generic AI Ethics statements that don't help shape the system

> **Focus**: Connect what your community values to what you actually
> build.

## How the Framework is Organised

The Framework is focused on the role of the developer. The Toolkit, the
Community of Practice and the AI Developer Companion are all provided to
help developers during each stage of their project, from idea through to
deployment, and during the in-life state:

| **Concept(Research) → Prototype/Pilot → Production → Operations** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

Figure 1: Typical AI development stages

Depending on the type of projects you’re running, you might not be
running certain stages. Perhaps you’re using well researched tools and
head straight to prototype, for instance. That’s fine, the framework can
help you address AI Safety and Ethics considerations however you are
bringing your ideas to life.

The Framework is designed to minimise overheads. Artefacts you create in
early stages get reused later where you improve them and add precision,
thanks to any research and prototyping you performed. For example,
values and risks identified in concept phase can be carried forward to
prototype.

### Alignment to your activities

Resources are organised according to familiar developer activities
common to any stage. Depending on the stage you’re at, the help you need
and the questions you ask when performing those activities will differ.
For example, during Concept questions will focus on higher level ideas
and expectations; by the time you’re developing for production they’ll
be addressing specific values, risks, behaviours and configuration.

Figure 2: Developer Activities Supported by the AISSE Framework

The activities in this figure are not a process or development flow, you
don’t have to manage your project following these – use what works for
you. When you want to use the toolkit you can check and find the right
assistance by asking yourself *“What am I working on right now?”*

If you would prefer to have something guided, Appendix B presents a flow
for projects who might be unfamiliar with applying AISSE during
development. Projects are welcome to use this flow, but it is not a
requirement.

Appendix C contains more details on the sorts of questions and
challenges projects might have, depending on which stage they are at
(research, prototype, pilot, production) and in operations.

### Support across all levels of AI complexity

Artificial Intelligence has a broad set of cognitive capabilities.
Projects using well established approaches – e.g. training a
single-purpose ML model – will face different challenges than those
working on emerging approaches. The assistance in the framework is
marked according to its suitability for helping with challenges on
values, risks and considerations that are known, foreseeable or
emergent. Whether you’re looking for tools to help you check bias in
data or trying to imbue AGI with values, resources are available.

The three labels in use are:

**Known**

- Well-documented concerns with established approaches

- Clear understanding of both risks and value alignment strategies

- Proven solutions and quantifiable measures available

**Foreseeable**

- Theoretically understood challenges and opportunities

- Identified vulnerabilities and emerging value considerations

- Proposed approaches needing validation at scale

**Emergent**

- Novel challenges without precedent

- Limited understanding requiring adaptive strategies

- Hypothesis-driven approaches for both safety and beneficial outcomes

Most types of resource will have content or tools for each complexity
level, but individual documents, tools, guides, etc. will often be
labelled for only one or two to indicate their suitability. E.g. a bias
removal tool for data might be labelled **Known.**

### What kinds of topics are the focus of the AISSE Framework?

The AISSE Framework focuses on the challenges of implementing AI with
attention to Safety, Security and Ethics. Tools and resources are
dependent on community contribution, but the scoping for the framework
is for resources on:

- Technical implementation of functionalities and mitigations to address
  AISSE in the development of agents

- Creation of environments that steer emergent intelligence towards
  positive outcomes (agentic and ASI, which we can’t fully predict
  through design)

- Identifying values and risks relevant to a particular technology,
  project scope, stakeholder group or industry (What matters to
  humanity)

- Translating goals into a design to maximise positives aligned to
  identified values (what are the dangers?)

- Understanding how a system/component interacts within a larger
  architecture/supply-chain with respect to safety, security and/or
  ethics

- Practical questions on managing a particular stage/activity in
  development in a way that addresses AISSE and uses the framework.

- Understanding what is going on inside an in-life system or when
  something is changing (for better or worse)?

## Support Available 

The AISSE Framework has three key components that offer support and
resources to developers, hosted on the AISSE platform.

### AISSE Platform

The AISSE Platform provides a single location for resources. The
Platform is curated and governed by the SingularityNET AISSE Community
of Practice\* who ensure the Framework is available, flexible and simple
to use

The AISSE Platform also houses the AISSE Directory, an automated tool
allowing developers to showcase their approach and efforts to address
AISSE considerations. Developers can choose to sign-up their project and
GitHub repository to feature in the AISSE directory and provide evidence
to reputation system and ecosystem showcases\*
