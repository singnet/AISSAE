### Impact Areas & Values Identified
<!--%IMPACT_IN-->
| Impact Area       | Description     | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW      | Rationale |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| PRIOIMPLearning Effectiveness | Improving student understanding and academic outcomes | High | M | Core educational purpose and key success metric |
| Educational Equity | Ensuring all students benefit regardless of background | High | M | Fundamental education principle and legal requirement |
| Student Agency | Maintaining student autonomy in learning choices | High | M | Essential for healthy development and engagement |
| Teacher Support | Enhancing rather than replacing teacher capabilities | High | M | Critical for school adoption and educational quality |
| Privacy Protection | Safeguarding student data and learning records | High | M | Legal requirement under GDPR and child protection |
| Digital Literacy | Developing students' AI and technology understanding | Medium | S | Important life skill but secondary to core learning |
| Parent Transparency | Keeping parents informed about AI-assisted learning | Medium | S | Builds trust and supports home learning |

### Risks Identified
<!--%RISKS_IN-->
| Impact Area | Risk | Description | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW | Rationale |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| PRIORISKSEducational Equity | AI bias creating unequal learning outcomes | Could perpetuate or worsen educational inequalities | High | M |
| Student Agency | Over-reliance on AI reducing independent thinking | Fundamental concern about learning dependency | High | M |
| Privacy Protection | Unauthorised use of student data | Legal and safeguarding requirement | High | M |
| Learning Effectiveness | AI providing incorrect information or guidance | Could harm educational outcomes and trust | High | M |
| Teacher Support | Deskilling of teachers through AI dependency | Long-term professional development concern | Medium | S |
| Digital Literacy | Students not understanding AI limitations | Important for critical thinking development | Medium | S |
| Parent Transparency | Lack of understanding about AI decision-making | Can be addressed through communication | Low | C |

### Tensions between values
See guidance. Record here any tensions noted in the process of identifying Values and Risks

- Personalisation vs. Privacy: Effective personalisation requires extensive data collection
- Efficiency vs. Deep Learning: Quick AI assistance may discourage deeper thinking
- Equity vs. Personalisation: One-size-fits-all may be fairer but less effective
- Innovation vs. Safety: Advanced AI features may introduce unpredictable behaviours
- Teacher Support vs. Student Independence: Too much AI mediation may reduce direct teacher-student interaction

## AISSE Decisions

**AISSE Badge level commitment** (Bronze/Silver/Gold):<!--%BADGE_LEVEL-->Silver

**Rationale:** 
Educational technology affecting children requires careful attention to safety and ethics, but operational deployment necessitates practical approach balancing thoroughness with usability. Silver level provides robust framework without excessive overhead.

**Risk Threshold Levels:** (Conservative/Moderate/Risk-Tolerant/Custom):<!--%THRESHOLD_LEVEL-->Moderate

**Rationale:**
Educational context requires balancing innovation with safety. Moderate thresholds allow beneficial features while maintaining appropriate safeguards for child users and educational integrity.
